This is some documentation on my python script to output certain words from
a file. 

What it does: Outputs specified words from a given file.

Output should be the entire line that contains a specified word. For example:
If the search word was "entire" and that word was contained in a line with
other strings ("I ate my entire meal."), then the output will be "I ate my 
entire meal."


How to run: Change to the directory of the script, make the file executable 
(chmod +x scriptName.py), and type "python3 scriptName.py
